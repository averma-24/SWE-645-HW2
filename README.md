Conclusion :
By following these steps we were able to
1. Containerize the Web application we developed in Homework 1 â€“ Part 2, using Docker
container technology.
2. Deployed the containerized application on the open source container orchestration platform
Kubernetes to enable scalability and resiliency of the application with baseline configuration of
at least three pods running all the time.
3. Used Rancher (https://rancher.com/docs) to set up the Kubernetes cluster.
4. Established a CI/CD pipeline that includes a Git source code repository at GitHub, and Jenkins
for automated build and for the automated deployment of our application on Kubernetes.
